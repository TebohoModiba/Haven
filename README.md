HavenAI (Hackathon Project)

I created this app with my classmate and teammate, **Rumbidzai Maburutse** for the Hackathon hosted by our university.
The theme of the hackathon was **“AI to Empower Society.”**

Our goal was to build a solution that leverages artificial intelligence to address real-world challenges and create a positive social impact.
